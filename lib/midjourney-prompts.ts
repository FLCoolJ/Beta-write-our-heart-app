const BASE_PROMPT = `Create a front cover for a 5x7 boutique-quality greeting card that looks artist-designed and emotionally rich, like a luxury Hallmark Signature or Papyrus card. The design should feel handmade and poetic, with layered textures, embossed-like effects, and warm, luxe lighting. Use soft, natural symbolism (like watercolor florals, elegant feathers, textured brush strokes, or gold foil leaves). The aesthetic should feel high-end, gift-worthy, and worthy of framingâ€”something the recipient would keep. Avoid generic clipart or obvious digital filters. Use a creamy, matte background with artisan details. Use textured backgrounds: search "linen," "paper grain," "watercolor wash" Layer text with drop shadows or light bevels, Add gold foil textures or frame borders handwritten font that feels timeless (e.g., Playfair Display, Cormorant Garamond)`
